numbers for usecases in uml

welcomescreen?

share lists only an option?

after createing a list, there should be a ability to share and add items

shopping lists I got added to will appear in the notificationcenter where i can add or reyect.

conflicts in names should be resolved

use shoppinglist <> edit shoppiglist

usecase edit list instead of different usecases check, add, edit etc

keep remove, check, add as different usecases but on the same screen
